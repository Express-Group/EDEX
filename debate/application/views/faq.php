						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">My school is not keen on this but I want to take part? What do I do?</h5>
						<p>Since this is an inter-school competition, we're afraid there's not much we can do. But do write to us at edex.chief@gmail.com and we will do our best to help.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">Who will I be debating with?</h5>
						<p>Over 50 top schools from India are being invited to nominate their best debaters in either age category. So you could be matched up against anyone from literally anywhere. How's that for unpredictability in diversity?</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">How many people will I be debating with?</h5>
						<p>Each preliminary debate will have eight participants. The matching and selection criteria will be done using an algorithm <i>(cool way of saying 'we got an app')</i> to avoid regional bias.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">How long will the debate run for?</h5>
						<p>The debate itself will run for an hour, but the produced, edited version will run for 30-40 minutes on our social media channels. Every session will start with a brief introduction to accepted debate norms, terminology and a quick rundown of the topic and will run for 45 minutes.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">Can I choose my topic?</h5>
						<p>No way. That takes the element of surprise away. Instead, you will receive the topic 48 hours in advance. But there's a twist: You will only be told whether you are speaking FOR or AGAINST the motion at the beginning of the session. So be prepared to go wither way! Debaters will be given 5 minutes of common prep time to gather their presentations and speak to the house.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">How much time do we get to speak for?</h5>
						<p>Every speaker gets 4 minutes of initial presentation and 3 minutes of rebuttal. There will be no interruption, under any circumstances, when another speaker is speaking. You'll lose some serious points there.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">What are we judged on?</h5>
						<p>Debaters will be marked on their content, style, presentation, adherence to norms and body language. Humour is always an added bonus! After the debate airs, audience voting will be open for 48 hours and that, in conjunction with the judge's marks, will decide the top two winners. The eight top debaters will face off in the finale and the top two debaters will walk away with the rolling trophy for their school.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						
						<h5 style="font-weight: 600;color: #264e82;">How do we know when it will be on air?</h5>
						<p>We will notify you the day it airs via mail. You could also watch out for our ads online on social media and in The New Indian Express.</p>
						<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #264e82;">
						<p>Let's go young India. Let's debate! </p>
